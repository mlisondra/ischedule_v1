<h2>About iSchedule 247 </h2>
<p> We're friends and developers <a href= "http://www.vdapro.com" target="_blank"> (VDA Pro)</a> from the Silicon Valley with very typical, 
busy family lives and activities. We developed this originally for commerical intent but 
have since put a fairly dynamic version out for free use. Even for free, we really feel there
is simple but great value in iSchedule 247.
</p>
<p>
The genesis of iSchedule 247 came from all those moms, carpool parents, sports team 
managers, office managers, and the like, who dedicatedly organize many calendars of events. 
iSchedule 247 intends to do it all very easily. PLUS it provides the ability 
to remind all those involved of their events automatically to their email and or mobile devices. 
It is basically a centralized way to handle one or more calendars in one place AND 
automatically send out reminders to anyone from your group without anyone except the calendar manager
to create an account.
</p>
<p>
iSchedule 247 makes it really user-friendly. From accessing your calendar quickly and easily 
visualizing calendars and events and automatically sending out reminders and notifications to anyone - 
iSchedule247 will absolutely help organize the events in your life, your family, your sports 
teams, your workforce, your contract jobs and any of your interests.
