<h2>iSchedule 247 FAQs</h2>
<p> <b>1. Do my contacts have to pay anything to receive reminders from iSchedule 247?</b><p>
No and they don't have to be subscribers either. We also presume if they are receiving text/SMS 
reminders that they typically have the "all you can eat" text/SMS plans (mobile support is U.S. 
based at this time). Also, there are upgrades available for enterprise and business use, i.e., more calendar
categories & contacts. <a href="mailto:support@ischedule247.com?subject=iSchedule247
